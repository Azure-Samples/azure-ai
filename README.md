# Azure AI Hub
This repository is intended to be the central hub for the Azure AI developer community. An Azure AI developer is someone who uses or would like to integrate AI into their apps using various Azure AI services such as Cognitive Services (around Language/Speech/Vision) such as OpenAI and Applied AI services such as Form Recognizer

## Features
This repository will provide the following:
* A list of curated Azure AI code samples around top Azure AI developer jobs to be done and the most popular end-to-end customer scenarios that use AI. 
* An active discussions hub for the community to ask questions or provide feedback to the Azure AI product teams, and just have discussions around Azure AI SDKs  
* Any other suggestions are welcome!

## Getting Started
Head over to the Discussions tab and introduce yourself, start a new topic or jump in to an existing one. Alternately, dig into the below samples, then come back to our discussions and let us know what you think. 

## Azure AI code samples 

Make sense of a large dataset using OpenAI [**OpenAI based Summarization**](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/summarization-python-openai) in a Python notebook 

Integrate Speech AI into your applications using your programming language of choice with [**Speech SDK samples**](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/blob/master/README.md#sample-repository-for-the-microsoft-cognitive-services-speech-sdk) 

Translate documents from and into more than 100 different languages using [**Document Translation sample apps**](https://github.com/MicrosoftTranslator/DocumentTranslation) 

Extract, classify, and understand text within documents using **Text Analytics based NLP** in [**Python**](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/textanalytics/azure-ai-textanalytics/samples/README.md#samples-for-azure-text-analytics-client-library-for-python), [**.NET**](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/tree/main/sdk/textanalytics/Azure.AI.TextAnalytics/samples#azure-cognitive-services-text-analytics-client-library-for-net), [**TypeScript**](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/main/sdk/textanalytics/ai-text-analytics/samples/v5/typescript#azure-text-analytics-client-library-samples-for-typescript), [**JavaScript**](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/main/sdk/textanalytics/ai-text-analytics/samples/v5/javascript/README.md#azure-text-analytics-client-library-samples-for-javascript), and [**Java**](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/blob/main/sdk/textanalytics/azure-ai-textanalytics/src/samples/README.md#azure-cognitive-services-for-language-client-library-samples-for-java)  

Extract structured data from forms, receipts, invoices, and cards using **Form Recognizer** in [**Python**](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/formrecognizer/azure-ai-formrecognizer/samples/README.md#samples-for-azure-form-recognizer-client-library-for-python), [**.NET**](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/main/sdk/formrecognizer/Azure.AI.FormRecognizer/samples/README.md#common-scenarios-samples-for-client-library-version-400), [**TypeScript**](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/main/sdk/formrecognizer/ai-form-recognizer/samples/v4/typescript/README.md#azure-form-recognizer-client-library-samples-for-typescript), [**JavaScript**](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/main/sdk/formrecognizer/ai-form-recognizer/samples/v4/javascript/README.md#azure-form-recognizer-client-library-samples-for-javascript), and [**Java**](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/blob/main/sdk/formrecognizer/azure-ai-formrecognizer/src/samples/README.md#azure-form-recognizer-client-library-samples-for-java)
