# Azure AI Hub
This repository is intended to be the central hub for the Azure AI developer community. An Azure AI developer is someone who uses or would like to integrate AI into their apps using various Azure AI services such as Cognitive Services (around Language/Speech/Vision) such as OpenAI and Applied AI services such as Form Recognizer

## Features
This repository will provide the following:
* A list of curated [samples](https://aka.ms/azai/samples) around top Azure AI developer jobs to be done and the most popular end-to-end customer scenarios that use AI. 
* An active [discussions](https://aka.ms/azai) channel for the community to ask questions or provide feedback to the Azure AI product teams, and just have discussions around Azure AI SDKs and tools
* Any other suggestions are welcome!

## Getting Started
Head over to the [Discussions](https://aka.ms/azai) tab and introduce yourself, start a new topic or jump in to an existing one. Alternately, dig into the below samples, then come back to our discussions and let us know what you think. 

## Azure AI code samples 

Use **OpenAI** to make sense of a large dataset using [**Query based Summarization**](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/summarization-python-openai) in a Python notebook 

Use **Translator** to translate documents from and into more than 100 different languages using [**Document Translation sample apps**](https://github.com/MicrosoftTranslator/DocumentTranslation) 

Use **Form Recognizer** to automate a paper based process using the [**New patient registration with Form Recognizer workshop**](https://newpatiente2e.github.io/docs/)

Integrate **Speech** AI into your apps using your programming language of choice with [**Speech SDK samples**](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/blob/master/README.md#sample-repository-for-the-microsoft-cognitive-services-speech-sdk) 

Extract, classify, and understand text within documents using **Text Analytics** in [**Python**](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/textanalytics/azure-ai-textanalytics/samples/README.md#samples-for-azure-text-analytics-client-library-for-python), [**.NET**](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/tree/main/sdk/textanalytics/Azure.AI.TextAnalytics/samples#azure-cognitive-services-text-analytics-client-library-for-net), [**TypeScript**](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/main/sdk/textanalytics/ai-text-analytics/samples/v5/typescript#azure-text-analytics-client-library-samples-for-typescript), [**JavaScript**](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/main/sdk/textanalytics/ai-text-analytics/samples/v5/javascript/README.md#azure-text-analytics-client-library-samples-for-javascript), and [**Java**](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/blob/main/sdk/textanalytics/azure-ai-textanalytics/src/samples/README.md#azure-cognitive-services-for-language-client-library-samples-for-java)  

Extract structured data from forms, receipts, invoices, and cards using **Form Recognizer** in [**Python**](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/formrecognizer/azure-ai-formrecognizer/samples/README.md#samples-for-azure-form-recognizer-client-library-for-python), [**.NET**](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/main/sdk/formrecognizer/Azure.AI.FormRecognizer/samples/README.md#common-scenarios-samples-for-client-library-version-400), [**TypeScript**](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/main/sdk/formrecognizer/ai-form-recognizer/samples/v4/typescript/README.md#azure-form-recognizer-client-library-samples-for-typescript), [**JavaScript**](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/main/sdk/formrecognizer/ai-form-recognizer/samples/v4/javascript/README.md#azure-form-recognizer-client-library-samples-for-javascript), and [**Java**](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/blob/main/sdk/formrecognizer/azure-ai-formrecognizer/src/samples/README.md#azure-form-recognizer-client-library-samples-for-java)
